# FRC_Team_5036_2018
This is the source code for FRC Team 5036's 2018 robot. I was the sole programmer again this year and it was my last year as a student. At
the Durham College event, we won the Innovation in Control Award for our implementation of PID loops and use of a variety of sensors. We
also went on to qualify for the World Championships for a 2nd straight year.

If you're reading this in 2021 and got here from my resume, keep in mind that I was in 12th grade when I wrote this so it is obviously pretty trash.
I also prioritized writing the code and pushing it to the robot quickly to be able to have as much time as possible for our driver to practice with
the robot. Some stuff was also done quickly at competitions.

For anyone reading this in 2022 and got here from my resume: In the past I just wrote that I programmed the robot, but this time, I also wrote that I 
designed the robot. I CADed the robot that year (and the previous two years). (We would come up with the high-level design as a team). As a result of 
having CADed the robot, I was also heavily involved in constructing the robot. You can find the CAD for this robot here: https://workbench.grabcad.com/workbench/projects/gccV1FaFMSPiQNCNtqskA3lJWx27oo_KmvAU6Xeazc0iiL#/space/gcvkaHrcvONsdF6I_VLH7veCs9OQ94jKJHc2-TTEmKNJlb
