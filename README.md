# FRC_Team_5036_2018
This is the source code for FRC Team 5036's 2018 robot. I was the sole programmer again this year and it was my last year as a student. At
the Durham College event, we won the Innovation in Control Award for our implementation of PID loops and use of a variety of sensors. We
also went on to qualify for the World Championships for a 2nd straight year.
